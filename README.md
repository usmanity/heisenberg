# Heisenberg
A font in progress, this font is mostly for myself to learn and maybe you can use it as an example/starter.

This file is created using [FontRapid for Sketch](https://fontrapid.com/)

**Current version**  
Current version is available to download but will not include most characters right now. Each version will include more characters.
